# zcus_toolbox
Custom Tool box for TRM

The Requirement Says Need to create a toolbox where we can create TR, delete TR, Add User, Change Owner and Also can release the TR.
So this is linked with my zimro_box program. From there any end user can raise a TR release request for the approver and approver can approve and release the TR.

We have Create, Delete or Modify TR options. For modification we have authorization only aithroized people can access that.
