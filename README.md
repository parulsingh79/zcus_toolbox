Custom Tool box for TRM

The Requirement Says Need to create a toolbox where we can create TR, delete TR, Add User, Change Owner and Also can release the TR.
So this is linked with my zimro_box program. From there any end user can raise a TR release request for the approver and approver can approve and release the TR.
